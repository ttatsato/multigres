	// IMPORTANT — Filter is one-way at the event boundary. The cache

	//     its topology record is deleted or its lifecycle transitions
	//     to SHUTDOWN.
	//
	// Filters that read dynamic external state (e.g. a reloadable

	// MissingGracePeriod is how long an entry can stay in
	// StateMissingFromTopo before the cache forgets about it. The grace
	// is designed to survive two operational failure modes:
	//
	//   1. A pooler stops without gracefully marking itself SHUTDOWN in
	//      etcd, and whatever component should have hard-deleted its
	//      topology entry hasn't. The cache keeps the entry visible so
	//      consumers can drain in-flight work and analyzers see it.
	//   2. etcd contents are lost or trashed and an operator hasn't yet
	//      restored them. The pooler process itself may be reachable the
	//      whole time; we must NOT evict it just because etcd forgot it.
	//
	// Case 2 is the reason LastReachedTimestamp exists (see below): if
	// the cache only used time-since-NoNode, a healthy pooler whose etcd
	// record was lost would be silently evicted after the grace expired.
	// With LastReachedTimestamp wired in, the effective deadline becomes
	// "MissingGracePeriod after the last evidence the pooler was reached
	// on the wire" — so an etcd outage alone won't drop a working pooler.
	MissingGracePeriod time.Duration

	// LastReachedTimestamp, if non-nil, returns the most recent time the
	// rider was reached on the wire — i.e. the consumer got SOME response

	// responses also count (the pooler clearly exists). Connection
	// failures and RPC timeouts do NOT count, since they're not evidence
	// of a process at the other end.
	//
	// The cache consults this during sweep for entries in
	// StateMissingFromTopo: the eviction deadline becomes
	// max(disposeAfter, lastReached + MissingGracePeriod). A zero time
	// is treated as "no positive evidence" — the deadline stays at the
	// NoNode-anchored disposeAfter.
