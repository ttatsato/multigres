	// reservation is sticky: it survives DISCARD ALL and is released only at
	// the connection's real teardown (client disconnect). That release does
	// not clear the seed on the backend either; a later, unrelated session can
	// be handed this same backend with its PRNG already seeded from the prior
	// one. That residual-state gap is accepted here: it only affects the

	// ReasonUnsafeConnection indicates the connection is running as an unsafe connection
	// (the per-connection opt-out that suppresses the unsafe-statement
	// rejections). Such a connection may run statements that change untracked
	// backend session state, so its backend must never be returned to the shared
	// pool where that change would leak to another client. Pinned to a single
	// backend for the session's lifetime and, like ReasonSetSeed, sticky: it
